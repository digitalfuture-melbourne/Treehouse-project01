# Treehouse-project01

This is a project that requires me to display a quote onto the site, the quote must consists of the quote itself, the author, citation, year 
and or/tag if applicable.

The sites was created with pre-collected quote from the internet and coded into an array.

The website is then required to display the quote and change the page background color as well.

The last part of the project requires a timer which was set a 10seconds to automatically load a new quote and change the background color.
